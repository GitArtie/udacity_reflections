What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git folder is created. It is needed to store meta data of commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains only those files from the working directory that will be included in the next commit. The repository contains all commits. The staging area can thus be used to separate commits into logically connected chunks.
