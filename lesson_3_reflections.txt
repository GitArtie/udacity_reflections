When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- To make files available from everywhere for different machines.

- To share and collaborate with others.
- To have a secure copy on the web.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- To keep an online backup.
- To keep traffic low.
- To not lose work due to unexpected updates.
