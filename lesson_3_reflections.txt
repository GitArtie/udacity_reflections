When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- To make files available from everywhere for different machines.

- To share and collaborate with others.
- To have a secure copy on the web.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- To keep an online backup.
- To keep traffic low.
- To not lose work due to unexpected updates.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- A fork is a clone of a repository on GitHub. Use when you want to work on someone else's content.
- A clone is a copy of a repository. Use when you want to modify a repository locally or when you want to keep a backup of a repository.
- A branch is a series of commits. Use when adding a new feature or experimental change to a commit in your repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- You can work offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
- Having a common online storage where everyone can upload new file versions. Communication would need to happen on a different platform. Versioning would be a problem to think about.
